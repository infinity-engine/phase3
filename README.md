# Optimization Methods in Engineering

#### Constraint Optimization using Penalty Function Method.
The goal in every industry is to minimise or 
maximise a particular quantity. And in the real world there 
are generally multiple variables in the problem. To achieve 
the goal, Optimisation methods were introduced. These 
methods help us in narrowing down the search area for a 
particular optimum solution. 
Here for this report, we have written the code for finding the 
optimum points of 3 different objective functions with 
several constraints for each one of them
